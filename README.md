# image2include

user @AHK-just-me created this image2include script years ago here:  
https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/93292-image2include-include-images-in-your-scripts/

this repository updates the generated output so that it is also backwards compatible with AHK Basic 1.0  

the main script still need to be run with AHK 1.1
